# 30-Day SEO Ranking Plan

## Goal
Increase qualified organic traffic by improving topical authority, on-page quality, and internal link structure while keeping technical SEO stable.

## Baseline (Day 1)
- Export current top pages/queries from Google Search Console.
- Track these KPIs:
  - Impressions
  - Clicks
  - CTR
  - Average position
  - Indexed pages count
- Define 3 priority topic clusters:
  - Next.js / web dev
  - Self-hosting / Ubuntu server
  - AI workflows / tooling

## Week 1 (Days 1-7): Quick Wins
- Fix highest-value SEO warnings first:
  - Missing or wrong `canonical_url`
  - Weak title/description on top 20 pages
- Standardize metadata quality:
  - Title target: 45-60 chars
  - Description target: 120-160 chars
- Add internal links from top pages to 2-4 related pages each.
- Ensure each post has one clear primary keyword in:
  - Title
  - First paragraph
  - One H2

## Week 2 (Days 8-14): Content Upgrades
- Refresh 8 existing posts with high impressions + low CTR:
  - Rewrite title + meta description for click appeal.
  - Add FAQ section (`## FAQ`) with long-tail phrasing.
  - Add 3-5 contextual internal links.
- Merge/redirect overlapping low-value posts where needed.

## Week 3 (Days 15-21): New Ranking Content
- Publish 3 cluster support posts (1 per priority cluster).
- Publish 1 pillar page update (long-form, structured guide).
- Add “Related reading” blocks to all 4 new/updated pieces.

## Week 4 (Days 22-30): Authority & Distribution
- Ship 1 linkable asset:
  - Template, checklist, benchmark, or mini-tool post.
- Promote each new piece:
  - X/LinkedIn post
  - 2 niche communities
  - 1 relevant newsletter/forum mention
- Request 3-5 contextual backlinks from relevant contacts/sites.

## Ongoing Rules
- Every new post must include:
  - Canonical URL
  - Strong title/description
  - At least 3 internal links
  - 1 image with descriptive alt text
- Weekly:
  - Run `yarn validate:content`
  - Run `yarn validate:seo`
  - Review Search Console query gains/losses

## Success Criteria (End of 30 Days)
- +15-25% clicks on refreshed pages
- CTR improvement on at least 10 priority pages
- 4+ new pages indexed
- 10+ pages internally re-linked with contextual anchors
