## Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the core components and utilities used in this blog:

- **`components/ArticleContent.tsx`**: Renders the main content of each article with Markdown formatting.
- **`components/ArticleCard.tsx`**: Displays a brief preview of each article in the blog home.
- **`utils/getArticleMetadata.ts`**: Utility to extract metadata from each Markdown file.
- **`utils/getArticleContent.ts`**: Utility to retrieve and parse the content of each Markdown file.

## Markdown Structure

Each Markdown file should contain front matter for metadata. Example structure:

```markdown
---
title: "The Arctic Predator"
date: "2024-05-13"
description: "Polar bears, majestic predators of the Arctic, are facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change..."
---

### The Arctic Predator

Content goes here...
```

Place all your Markdown files in the `articles` folder. The filename will be used as the `slug` for routing.

### Example of Generated Metadata

Each page's metadata is generated dynamically to reflect the article title:

- Page title: `My Blog - [Article Title]`
- Description: Based on `description` in the article's front matter

### Sharing Articles

Blog posts now include a share section with buttons for:

- Twitter (X)
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- Copy to clipboard

These buttons appear at the bottom of each article and are dynamically generated based on the article's title and URL.
To ensure correct sharing links, make sure to set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
````

This is used to construct full URLs for sharing from the `ShareButtons` component:
```
<ShareButtons title={articleTitle} url={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/${folder}/${slug}`} />
```
