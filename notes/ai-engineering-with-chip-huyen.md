  On today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I’m joined by Chip Huyen, a computer scientist, author of the freshly published O’Reilly book AI Engineering, and an expert in applied machine learning. Chip has worked as a researcher at Netflix, was a core developer at NVIDIA (building NeMo, NVIDIA’s GenAI framework), and co-founded Claypot AI. She also taught Machine Learning at Stanford University.

# AI Engineering with Chip Huyen
## One Sentence Summary:
The podcast explores AI engineering, emphasizing practical approaches, fundamentals, and evolving practices for building effective AI applications.

## Main Points:
1. AI engineering shifts focus from model creation to engineering, product, and data management.
2. Building AI applications now often involves API calls, lowering entry barriers and expertise needed.
3. The field is full-stack, integrating system design, product thinking, and traditional machine learning.
4. Fundamentals like retrieval-augmented generation and evaluation methodologies remain crucial.
5. Writing a comprehensive AI book requires deep research, referencing thousands of sources, and ongoing learning.
6. AI engineering emphasizes starting with prototypes, then iterating with data, prompts, and fine-tuning.
7. Evaluation of AI systems is complex; human judgment, automated metrics, and comparative assessments are used.
8. Common mistakes include using AI unnecessarily, over-reliance on frameworks, and neglecting domain understanding.
9. Learning AI benefits from project-based approaches combined with structured study and domain insights.
10. Future of AI includes automation of coding, education, entertainment, and organizational efficiency.

## Takeaways:
- Focus on solving real problems with simple, effective solutions before resorting to complex models.
- Prioritize understanding your domain and user needs through data inspection and user feedback.
- Use iterative development: start with prompts, then incorporate retrieval, data prep, and fine-tuning.
- Evaluate AI performance with multiple methods, including human judgment, automated tests, and comparative analysis.
- Stay disciplined, avoid FOMO-driven experimentation, and build deep expertise through consistent practice.
